  abstract={Abstract It is shown that the derivative of the scattering phase shift with respect to energy, d η {dE,} must exceed a certain limit if the interaction of scattered particle and scatterer vanishes beyond a certain distance. This limitation of d η {dE} is, fundamentally, a consequence of the },

  title={Lifetime matrix in collision theory},
  issn={1536-6065},
  author={Smith, {FT}},
  abstract={Abstract The duration of a collision is usually a rather ill-defined concept, depending on a more or less arbitrary choice of a collision distance. If the collision lifetime is defined as the limit, as R→∞, of the difference between the time the particles spend within a distance R of each other and the time they would have spent there in the absence of the interaction, a well-defined quantity emerges which is finite as long as the interaction vanishes rapidly  ...},
